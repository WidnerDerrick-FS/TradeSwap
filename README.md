## 🎨 Frontend Components

Our frontend is built using [React](https://reactjs.org/). Key components include:

- **ItemListComponent**: Displays a list of items available for trade.
- **TradeComponent**: Handles the initiation and visualization of trades.
- ... <!-- Additional components -->

## 🗄️ Database Schemas

Our database structure utilizes MongoDB. A brief schema is outlined below:

- **Items Collection**:
  - `id`: Unique identifier for the item.
  - `name`: Name of the item.
  - `description`: Description of the item.
  - ... <!-- Additional fields -->

- **Users Collection**:
  - `id`: Unique identifier for the user.
  - `username`: Chosen username.
  - `email`: User's email address.
  - ... <!-- Additional fields -->

## 🚄 Performance Optimizations

- **Caching**: We employ Redis for caching frequently accessed data, reducing database read operations.
- **Database Indexing**: Essential fields in our MongoDB collections are indexed for efficient queries.
- **Frontend Lazy Loading**: Assets are lazily loaded to speed up initial page load times.

## 🛡️ Security

- **Data Encryption**: All sensitive user data is encrypted at rest and in transit.
- **JWT**: We utilize JSON Web Tokens for stateless authentication.
- **Rate Limiting**: Protecting our endpoints from potential DDoS attacks.

## 🌐 Future Roadmap

- **User Surveys**: To gather feedback and improve our platform.
- **Gamification**: Introducing a points system to encourage more trades.
